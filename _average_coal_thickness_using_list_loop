# This example Python code uses coal thickness as an example

#Create a list to store borehole IDS
#borehole ids can be accessed using indexing and slicing.
boreholes=['a','b','c','d','e']
print(boreholes[0])

#create a list to store coal thicknesses in feet
coalthickness=[3.4,4.4,3.9,4.6,4.3]
#coal thickness can be accessed using indexing and slicing.
coalthickness[1]

#A for loop can be used to print contents of a loop.
for coalthick in coalthickness:
	print(coalthick)

#A for loop can be used to perform mathematical calculations
#Calculate average thickness of coal seams.	
s=0
for coalthick in coalthickness:
    s=s+coalthick
print(s)
print(len(coalthickness))
print(s/len(coalthickness))

#more advanced for loop to calculate coal thickness when coal is at least 4 feet
      
L4=[] # a list to contain thicknesses greater than 4 feet
for coalthick in coalthickness:
    if coalthick>=4:
        L4.append(coalthick)
print(L4, "List of thicknesses greater than 4 feet")
s=0
for coalthick in L4:
    s=s+coalthick
print(len(L4))
print(s/len(L4))
#print(sum(L4)/len(L4))
